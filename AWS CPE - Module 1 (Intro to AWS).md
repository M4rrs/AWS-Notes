## Deployment Modules for Cloud Computing
- Before selecting a cloud strategy, factors such as cloud application components, preferred resource management tools and legacy IT infrastructure requirements must be considered.
##### Cloud-Based Deployment
- Run all application parts in the cloud.
- Migrate existing applications.
- Create new applications.

- Apps built on low-level infrastructure requires IT staff to manage.
- Aps built using higher-level infrastructure; reduces management, architecting, & scaling requirements of core infrastructure.
- e.g. A fully cloud based application consisting of virtual servers, dbs and networking components.

##### On-Premises Deployment
- Uses virtualization and resource management tools.
- ^ Increases resource utilization.

- a.k.a. *Private Cloud Deployment*
- e.g. Applications run on technology that is kept fully in on-premises data center.

##### Hybrid Development
- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructures.
- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

- Use situations:
